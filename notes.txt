Choose 11 spots
wild card match ups and 1&2 seeds are fixed
Update 2nd round selections based on wild card rounds
1 seed plays highest number seed of wild card winners
2 seed plays other wild card winner

From Sai:
Let me go over the playoff structure. Each conference has 6 seeds, and if the playoffs started on Sunday, they'd be: 

AFC
1. NE Patriots
2. BAL Ravens
3. HOU Texans (yay)
4. DEN Broncos
5. PIT Steelers
6. CIN Bengals

NFC
1. GB Packers
2. SF 49ers
3. NO Saints
4. NY Giants/DAL Cowboys (really, they should just leave this spot blank)
5. DET Lions
6. ATL Falcons

THESE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Only Houston and Green Bay have clinched their seed. 

The 1 and 2 seeds get a bye in the wild card round. 3 plays 6, and 4 plays 5. 

Then there's a little bit of quirkiness as the NFL doesn't have a fixed bracket. the 1 seed will play the highest seeded team, so either the 4, 5, or 6. Likewise, the 2 will play either the 3, 4, or 5. All this means is that when you pick the two teams you expect to make it to the AFC/NFC championship games, make sure they won't already be playing each other in the previous round in your scenario. 

From then on out, it's all vanilla.

"afc wild card 1 (bengals @ texans), afc wild card 2, afc divisional 1 (x @ patriots), afc divisional 2, afc championship game, nfc wild card 1 (lions @ saints), nfc wild card 2, nfc divisional 1 (x @ packers), nfc divisional 2, nfc championship game, superbowl, score" 9:07
so like "Texans, Broncos, Patriots, Ravens, Patriots, Saints, Giants, Packers, 49ers, Packers, Packers, 150-135"
